# Today is a day, i guess?

If there's something I love is wasting 10 hours of my weekend reading the docs of the next new shiny thing (I'm looking at you [Suckless](https://suckless.org/)).

- I code using nvim (btw) inside ghostty (btw) with tmux (btw?) and sway (tiling window manager btw...)
- I really like Go, like a lot (seriously, I love it). I've been using [templ](https://templ.guide/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and ~Next.js~ hating on Next.js
- ðŸŽµ I recommend listening to Eagle Eyed Tiger and `2 8 1 4`
- ðŸ“– I recommend reading Brandon Sanderson and Haruki Murakami
