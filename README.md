If there's something I love is wasting 10 hours of my weekend reading the docs of the next new shiny thing (I'm looking at you [Suckless](https://suckless.org/)).

- I code using nvim (btw)
- Recently started using Go, and I'm loving it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Next.js
- 🎵 I recommend listening to Eagle Eyed Tiger
- 📖 I recommend reading Brandon Sanderson and Haruki Murakami
